# Highlights

> when someone has learned something that they _really_ wanted to pass on to future generations, more often than not they would write it down on paper

> it’s perhaps even more terrifying to imagine how much of human knowledge exists _only within the heads of living people_ – and what would happen if a generation of working-age adults were suddenly wiped out.

> I am a finely tuned sensor for the hypocrisy of others, and the indignation I feel towards someone else’s undocumented project is a powerful motivator.

> I document my work for the sensation of writing about it in the past tense. It gives a sense of completion, or at the very least of a transition

> document my work to convince myself that I should be proud of it, and to establish a framework in which I can understand it in the future, and to have something to point to when the work itself has been buried in time.

> want to document the work I’ve done on my home. I want to build a manual, with system diagrams, maintenance schedules, and any photographs I have of the house under construction
