Most software is built upon this idea that a user has to opt-out of some features. Most of them are for collecting data. Obviously, this raises some questions about privacy. So basically, by default, companies make users opt-out of these features, baked into the software. In some cases it even might be hard: how to find the right settings, how not to break the whole (convenience) chain because of it.

The opposite approach is something that feels more sustainable. Instead of making "an agreement" by default, make people *opting-in* in case they want some feature. This enables deeply connected community, as well as helps building more trustfull relationship between companies/builders and people.
